EASY
- Give bigger level bonus points for completing higher levels.
- Add 1, 2, 3, and 5 block shapes.
- Change the game board width and height. Make sure the blocks stay the same size.
- Make the game more retro by changing the piece colors and text fonts.


MEDIUM
- Add a key press and HTML button to swap the current piece and the preview piece.
- Update the game board to draw fancier blocks.
- Update the game board to draw a fancier background (a gradient or a picture).

HARD
- Add sound effects.
- Save the high score (in a cookie or localstorage), show it on the web page.
- Add a line complete animation. For example, the line flashes twice then disappears.
  Then after a moment the board moves down. Then the next piece appears at the top.
  and play resumes.

ADVANCED
- Add bomb pieces. Explode (remove) any board blocks that the piece touches.
- Add embedded time bombs to existing pieces. 1 block in a piece is a bomb. After a
  few more pieces drop the bomb explodes and removes any board blocks it touches.
- Change the Board class shapeData simple array to use a different data structure.
  Perhaps an array containing arrays of rows, each of which is an array of blocks.
  Then update the functions that reset the board, check for valid piece positions and
  check for line completion to use the new data structure.
