# JavaScript Tetris

This code was developed for a Kids Coding Camp and helps the student progress step by step in developing a basic Tetris game in JavaScript.

The course was originally hosted and taught from https://codesandbox.io/s/static-javascript-tetris-8q0bd2

The student should create a new project folder and then start by examining the code in each part in sequence. The code in each part builds upon the previous parts until the "checkpoint" part is reached.

Once the project is complete the student may expand and prove their understanding by completing the challenges.
